      "the science of geophysics studies the physical processes of the Earth\n",
      "Solid Earth geophyscis uses observations of physical phenomena to infer the inner structure of the planet.\n",
      "Involves numerical modeling of physical processes\n",
      "Inverse problems use numerical models to infer structure from observations.\n",
      "Different geophysical methods use different physical phenomena.\n",
      "Electromagnetic (EM) methods use electromagnetic waves and difusion.\n",
      "Gravity and magnetics use potential fields.\n",
      "Seismics and seismology use elastic waves from active (man-made) and passive (earthquakes) sources .\n",
      "Due to the high demmand for seismics, this method has a large range of well established open-source software.\n",
      "These include SU [SU], Madagascar, OpendTect, and GeBR.\n",
      "GMT for map plotting.\n",
      "Modeling codes usually on author website, no license\n",

      "Generally, \n",
      "this is done with \n",
      "a variety of \n",
      "numerical modeling techniques \n",
      "and inverse problems. \n",
      "The development of new algorithms\n",
      "usually involves copy and pasting of code, \n",
      "which leads to errors and poor code reuse. \n",
      "Added to this \n",

      "composed of various tools \n",
      "that don't communicate with each other \n",
      "(Fortran/C for computations, \n",
      "large complicated I/O files, \n",
      "Matlab/VTK for visualization, etc). \n",
      "Fatiando a Terra \n",
      "is a Python library \n",
      "that aims to unify the modeling pipeline \n",
      "inside of the Python language. \n",
      "This allows users \n",
      "to replace the traditional shell scripting\n",
      "with more versatile and powerful Python scripting. \n",
      "Together with the new IPython notebook, \n",
      "Fatiando a Terra can integrate \n",
      "all stages of the geophysical modeling process, \n",
      "like data pre-processing, \n",
      "inversion, \n",
      "statistical analysis, \n",
      "and visualization. \n",
      "However, \n",
      "the library can also be used \n",
      "for quickly developing stand-alone programs \n",
      "that can be integrated into existing pipelines. \n",
      "Plus, \n",
      "because functions inside Fatiando a Terra\n",
      "use a common data and mesh format, \n",
      "existing algorithms can be combined \n",
      "and new ideas can build upon \n",
      "existing functionality. \n",
      "This flexibility \n",
      "facilitates reproducible computations, \n",
      "prototyping of new algorithms, \n",
      "and interactive teaching exercises. \n",
      "Although the project \n",
      "has so far focused on potential field methods\n",
      "(gravity and magnetics), \n",
      "some numerical tools \n",
      "for other geophysical methods \n",
      "have been developed as well. \n",
      "The library already contains: \n",
      "fast implementations \n",
      "of forward modeling algorithms \n",

      "generic inverse problem solvers, \n",
